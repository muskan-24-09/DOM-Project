**DOM Project-1**

This project demonstrates basic manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript. It showcases how to access and modify HTML elements dynamically. Below is a brief description of what the code does:

**Code Description:**

1. HTML Structure:

-> A simple HTML document containing a `div` element with some initial inline styles.
->The `div` has an ID of `myDiv`, which is used to reference the element in JavaScript.

2. JavaScript:

->The JavaScript code accesses the `div` element using `document.getElementById`.
It then changes various styles of the `div` element, such as text color, background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, and width.


**Key Features:**

-> Dynamic Style Manipulation: Demonstrates how to dynamically change the styles of an HTML element using JavaScript.
-> DOM Access: Shows how to access an HTML element by its ID.
-> Inline Styling: The initial styles are set inline within the `div` element for demonstration purposes.

**Usage:**
To view this project, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The JavaScript code will execute automatically, applying the specified styles to the `div` element.
